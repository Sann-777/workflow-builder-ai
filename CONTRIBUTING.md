## Development Setup

See README.md for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
./scripts/local-dev.sh
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
def generate_workflow(description: str) -> WorkflowModel:
    """
    Generate a workflow from natural language description.
    
    Args:
        description: Natural language workflow description
        
    Returns:
        WorkflowModel with nodes and edges
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety

Example:
```javascript
const CustomNode = ({ id, data }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)
  
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    // JSX
  )
}
```

### Terraform (Infrastructure)

- Use descriptive resource names
- Add comments for complex configurations
- Use variables for configurable values
- Tag all resources appropriately

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Start both servers
./scripts/local-dev.sh

# In another terminal, run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
